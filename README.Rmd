# Ecotron Lake Experiment

## Hello Fishes

Here is a little introduction ! \
You will find in this documents every information you need on those data and the script and analyses going with it. \
I suggest you read everything to understand what we are talking about and to be aware of the choices and hypothesis I made. \
But as I know it's often easier to read and discuss about something we can see and play with, you can also begin by reading about the experiment, the list of files and jump directly to the hand on section to get directly into this data.

## Experiment

Information on the experimantal lake : [Aquacosm.pdf](Aquacosm.pdf)

## List and quick explanation of the different files

### Dataset in /data

#### Data bases listing the Tag_ids and the related information
See section [Tag data bases]() for more precision, else a quick summary :

  - **BDD_original complet.xslx**: row dataset input from the experiment \
    see explanation : [BDD_original_complet.xlsx explanation]()
  - **data_final.xlsx**, cleaned version of BDD_original with unification of notation and elimination of incoherent data probably coming from experipmental input error (such as tag_id found in wrong lake) \
    see explanation : [data_final.xlsx explanation]()
  - **data_final_ws.xlsx** : data_final with additional weight and size for juveniles and 2022 \
    see hypothesis and precision : [data_final_ws.xlsx explanation]()
  - **data_final_ws_norm.xlsx** : data_final with additional weight and size for juveniles and 2022 by using a normal distribution \
  this is the data used in my following analyses and the creation of usable subset (see section [Hands on the data, getting started]()) \
    see hypothesis and precision on this data : [data_final_ws_norm.xlsx explanation]()

#### Other data

  - **Lake_treatment.xlsx** : a table containing the experimental characteristics of each lake : Nutrients enrichment, presence of perch (predator species), and a Treatment column summarizing the two
    see precision : [Lake_tretment.xlsx explanation]()
  - **capture_history.inp** : a file containing usable data for capture recapture analyses with mark, i.e. capture history and corresponding frequencies
    see construction and esplanation : [capture_history.inp explanation]()

### Scripts

 - **construction_BDD.Rmd**
 - **importation_data.R**

## Diving deeper in the data

### Data bases

These data bases present the result of the fisheries that happened in the lake during the 5 years experiments. \
You will find a line for each fish observed, with the different information collected (Tag_id,date, size, weight, Lake_capture, Lake_released), and information about the experimental characteristics of this fishery (Method, Passage, Session).

\

#### BDD_original_complet.xlsx explanation

Simply the first data base I was given. \
Not necessary for a simple data usage. Need data cleaning before analyses.

\

#### data_final.xlsx explanation

Cleaned version of BDD_original_complet.xlsx, see the [construction_BDD.Rmd](construction_BDD.Rmd) file to precisely see the modification that where made. (Not necessary for a simple usage of the data)\

##### Columns description

| Columns name       | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Index**          | Number of this observation|
| **Date**           | Date of observation  (-dd/mm/yyyy-)|
| **Obs_status**     | Action done with this fish -introduction- -capture- -recapture- |
| **Lake_capture**   | The lake in which the fish was extracted, -NA- if it is a new introduction|
| **Method_capture** | How was the fish extracted ? -trawl- (in october or november each year), -creel- (for the perch during summer), or -draining- (for 2022, when the lake where emptied)|
| **Session_capture**| In 2019 a problem of efficiency made 2 fisheries necessary (one normal -A- and a second with brushing -B-)|
| **Passage_net**    | Every fishery had 3 net passage -1- -2- and -3-|
| **Tag_id**         | Tag identifying individually each fish bigger than 8g |
| **Species**        | The species of the fish (-pike-, -roach-, -perch-, -gudgeon-, -frog-)|
| **Weight**         | Weight (in g)|
| **Size**           | Size of the fish from head to the fork of the tail (in mm)|
| **Lake_released**  | The lake in which the fish was released, -NA- if it wasn't released|
| **Comment**        | Any additional information |


Let's see how it looks \
\

```{r Head of the data, echo=TRUE}

library(readxl)
BDD_f <- read_excel("data/data_final.xlsx", 
                    col_types = c("numeric","date","text","text","text","text","text",
                                  "text","text","numeric","numeric","text","text"), na = "")
knitr::kable(head(BDD_f))
```

\

#### data_final_ws.xlsx explanation

Same as above but weight and size where added as such

**For the juveniles** : \
Adding the mean weight and size of the measured and weighted juveniles from the same Lake and Year

**For jan 2022** :\
The hypothesis is that fishes weight and size didn't change between nov 2021 and jan 2022, because of the time gap (4 months only) and the fact that winter is a slow growth period \
This can be verified because some fishes where weighted at both occasion.
This difference didn't seem significant, I then accepted the first hypothesis\
Weight and size where added in 2022 by taking the associated weight and size from nov 2021

\

#### data_final_ws_norm.xlsx explanation

Exactly the same as above but

**For juveniles** : weight and size where added using a normal distribution coming from the measured and weighted juveniles from the same Lake and Year \
This was done for two reasons :

  - It's closer to the biologic reality
  - It diminishes the bias toward one over-represented value

### Other useful data
#### Lake_treatment.xlsx explanation

A short table giving the characteristics of each Lake :

  - **Nutrients** : TRUE if enriched
  - **Perch** : TRUE if there is no fisheries pressure on perches, i.e. presence of predators
  - **Treatment** :
    - 1 for Nutrients and no Perch
    - 2 for Nutrients and Perch
    - 3 for no Nutrients and no Perch
    - 4 for no Nutrients and Perch

```{r Head of lake Treatment, echo=TRUE}
Lake_treatment <- read_excel("data/Lake_treatment.xlsx", col_types =c("text","logical","logical","text"))
knitr::kable(head(Lake_treatment))
```

\

#### capture_history.inp explanation

This data is useful for capture recapture study and can be used with the RMark library \
Can be used for exemple with the Jolly-Seber models from oliviergimenez available on [one of his github repositories](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/bayes-multistate-jollyseber) \
\
**How was it made ?** \
Construction with capture_history.R ([see the code for details](capture_history.R)) from the data of [data_ws_norm.xlsx](data/data_ws_norm.xlsx) after importation (thanks to [importation_data.R](data/importation_data.R))\
Utilization of a subset of the data containing only tagged fishes from the annual fisheries of November.
Then summarizing the data to get : \

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(RMark)
#popan <- convert.inp("data/capture_history.inp")
#colnames(popan) <- c("capture_history", "frequency") # simply for better comprehension here
#head(popan)
```




## Hands on the data, getting started, quick guide

This is a little explanation of how to get started with this data \
It's often complicated to dive into such analyses so I wanted to give anyone who wants to use in a way in.\
There are probably other ways to look at the data but if you are in a hurry, or want to wrap your head around all this to get a better understanding, here is what you can do :

To be continued... (and where to put some data visualisation + numbers of line and column for every data.frame to have an idea of what we are dealing with)
